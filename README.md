In this work, a prediction model to estimate the real estate value based on critical attributes including location, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, size of the property and the lot size is developed. The primary objective of this model is for potential sellers to evaluate the house value without intervention of a real estate agent.Â 

The prediction model is developed using Python Scikit-Learn libraries. Prediction models performs a periodic updates using most recent real-estate data. Serialized prediction models are used by Django to provide interactive interface to the Apache web server. JavaScript, GoogleMaps API, D3 and WordPress templates are used to provide user-friendly experience to the users. Python Scrapy framework is used to collect real-estate data used in this work.
